	The main window consists of six different views. When <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> is started, the account view is shown. To change view click on the corresponding icon in the vertical list on the right side of the window.
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="accounts_and_categories"></a>Accounts &amp; Categories</h2></div></div></div><p>
		The first time you start <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> the account view is displayed with a predefined set of accounts and categories. These can be considered as an example or a starting point for a setup matching your own conditions. You can either begin by modifying the suggested accounts and categories or start from scratch with <span class="guimenu">File</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">New</span> (<span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>N</strong></span>).
	</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="new-account.png"></div><p>
		Accounts should be created to match your real world bank accounts plus at least one account for your cash. Categories are used to keep incomes and expenses better organised. Each transaction must be connected to an account and a category, or two accounts for transfers between accounts. To create accounts and categories use <span class="guimenu">Accounts</span> menu or the context menu in the list.
	</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="budget"></a>Budget</h3></div></div></div><p>
			<span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> allows you to specify a budget for each month and category. This way you can continuously compare actual and planned expenses. You can also check what your current budget will mean for your future wealth.
		</p><p>
			A budget is initially asked for when creating a category. Then you can update it from the budget tab at the bottom of the accounts view, for the category selected in the list. If the budget has not been set for a month, the budget for the previous month is used.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="edit-budget.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			You can choose to set budgets for only some categories. In the accounts list, budget and remaining budget (budget - expenses/incomes) is displayed in the second column. If not all categories have a budget, the total remaining budget only summarises the categories with budget and thus does not include actual expenses/incomes from other categories.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="account_view"></a>The Accounts View</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The account view displays a list of all accounts and categories, sorted alphabetically under each main type – accounts, incomes, and expenses. The rows for the main types displays the sum of all accounts/categories below.
		</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="accounts-view.png"></div><p>
			The list has four columns. The first simply displays the name of the account or category. The second does for categories display the budget for the selected period and what is left of the budget. Unless the <span class="guibutton">Show partial budget</span> option is checked, the budget (and remaining budget) is displayed for whole months, thus you can in the default mode see whats left to spend of the current monthly budget. The third column displays the change in value, while the last column displays the total value.
		</p><p>
			In the bottom of the accounts view, there is a box for selection period. The period controls within which dates statistics will be shown in the list. If the button for the from (start) date is unchecked, all transactions up til and including the to (end) date will be included. The third, <span class="guilabel">Change</span>, column displays the value of all transactions that occurred between the two dates – the change in total value from start to end date. The last column (<span class="guilabel">Total</span>) displays the total value of all transaction up til and including the end date, plus the initial balance for accounts. If from date is unset, change and total will be equal for all categories. For accounts the total represents the actual money present at the end date, and change the profit during the period.
		</p><p>
			By default, the period is set to run from the beginning of the current month to (including) current date. Thus, the current state of accounts and transactions so far during the month are shown.
		</p><p>
			Values for future dates are based on budgets and scheduled transactions (whichever is greatest). An account can be designated as budget account (default for current accounts), meaning that budgeted change will be added to the statistics displayed for this account. Otherwise this will only be added to the summarising account item (thus it will not necessarily equal the sum of account statistics).
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions"></a>Transactions</h2></div></div></div><p>
		After accounts and categories have been added, you can start recording transactions each time money have been deposited or withdrawn from one of you accounts. If you have kept book before, either on paper, or in another program, you can either import a file (see <a class="xref" href="using-eqonomize.html#import_export" title="Import &amp; Export of Data">the section called “Import &amp; Export of Data”</a>) or enter each transaction manually by hand. Just remember to enter the correct opening balance for each account.
	</p><p>
		Transactions can be entered in two ways, either with the new expense/income/transfer dialogs (where you have the option to create a recurring transaction), or from the transaction views. The latter option is usually preferred.
	</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions_expenses"></a>Expenses</h3></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="expenses-view.png"></div><p>
			The first time you record an expense you need to follow these steps:
			</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Switch to the expenses view, using the left-hand icons. The input focus is now in the description entry.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type in a description for the expense. Your free to use the description property as you want, but I suggest you keep short and consistent without any inflections, as a subcategory for optimum efficiency and good statistics. For example, if you buy a delicious red royal gala apple and have an expense category for fruit, the description will be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Apple</span>”</span>, and if you want to record additional information put <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Delicious red royal gala</span>”</span> as comment (others might find it more appropriate to use <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Groceries</span>”</span> as category and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Fruit</span>”</span> as description). Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>Tab</strong></span> and focus will move to the cost entry.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Enter what you paid. Note that the value should not be negative (except for refunds) and you do not need to type in currency. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>Tab</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select the date when the transaction occurred. To change the date, either write a valid date, select one from the pop-up calendar, or increment/decrement the displayed date with up/down keys. If you now press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>, the new expense record will be created, but we do not do that now since the current account and category probably are not correct.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select the correct account (where the money for the expense is taken from) and expense category from the drop-down lists on the right.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Optionally enter a comment (memo) for the expense.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="guibutton">Add</span> or press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> adds a transaction if pressed with input focus in the date or comment entry. Otherwise it moves input focus to the next entry.</p></div><p>
			Repeat the process to record another expense. When you enter the next (and all subsequent expenses) expense you can however usually do it more efficiently. Date, account and category will not be reset each time, so often you need at least not change account. More importantly <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> remembers the last expense entered for each unique description. When you enter a description, all values, except date, will be filled in with the properties of the last expense with the same description. Even more so, as you type the description a list will pop up with all previous descriptions with matching opening letters. This means that you often will follow this much shorter process:
			</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Type the first letter of a description and select the correct one from the list.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Check if the cost is the same this time and press enter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Check the date and press enter.</p></li></ol></div><p>
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions_incomes"></a>Incomes</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The same process as for recording expenses is repeated for incomes. Click the incomes icon on the left and enter an income instead of a cost (still positive, but instead means amount deposited, added, to the account).
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions_transfer"></a>Transfers</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The record a transfer from one account to another (for example an ATM withdrawal from a bank account to cash) follow the same process as for expenses and incomes. Click the transfer icon on the left. Enter the amount transferred (positive) and select the from account (withdrawn from) and the to account (deposited to).
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="refunds_and_repayments"></a>Refunds &amp; Repayments</h3></div></div></div><p>
			You should record a refund instead of an income when you receive money as a refund for a previous expense, to get the statistics right. This can for example be if you return a product and get your money back, or if you buy a present that you and your friend will give to a mutual friend, and you receive your friends share of the cost later.
		</p><p>
			The record a new refund use <span class="guimenu">Transactions</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">New Refund/Repayment</span> or the context menu with the refunded expense selected in the expense list. You will have to enter the amount of money refunded (initially set to full refund) and the date of the refund. In addition you should specify the product quantity returned by you. In the first case this is clearly 1, but in the second case this is less clear. It can either be 0.5 if you count it as a half product, or 0 if considered a whole gift (none returned). The use is more obvious if the quantity property is activated for all expenses and incomes. The refund is recorded as an expense with negative cost and quantity.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="refund.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			Repayments are used as refunds, but for incomes that you have been forced to repay.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="split_transactions"></a>Split Transactions</h3></div></div></div><p>
			Split transactions are used when a transfer to/from an account is instantly used for multiple transactions. This is not when money is withdrawn from a bank account through an ATM and you go shopping (that is first a transfer from a bank account to cash, then multiple regular expenses). A split transaction can for example be appropriate when you pay with your credit card in a store and tell them to withdraw some extra money, which you get as cash in your hand. You might also use splits when multiple products is bought with the same payment.
		</p><p>
			It is up to you how and when you want to use split transactions, as multiple ordinary transactions can be used with the same end result, even though one way might be a bit more correct than the other.
		</p><p>
			You can create a split from scratch with <span class="guimenu">Transactions</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">New Split Transaction...</span> or from the context menu. It is however often more efficient to use the join action. This way you can enter transactions the usual way and later join them in a split transactions. Select the transactions to join and activate <span class="guimenuitem">Join Transactions...</span> from the <span class="guimenu">Transactions</span> menu or the context menu, and enter a description. All transactions in a split transaction have a common date and account.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="split-transaction.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			To reverse the action and transform transactions in a split transaction to ordinary transactions, select a transaction and use <span class="guimenuitem">Split Up</span>.
		</p><p>
			In transaction list (ledger) for the account associated with the split, the split will be shown as only one transaction, but everywhere else the parts of the split will appear as ordinary transactions.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="scheduled_transactions"></a>Scheduled Transactions</h3></div></div></div><p>
			Transactions that have not occurred yet (with future dates) are called scheduled transactions and have certain special properties. Scheduled transactions can recurring, which means that transactions occurring regularly with certain intervals (usually on a certain day of month) do not need to be entered manually each time. This is often useful for bills and paychecks-
		</p><p>
			Single occurrence scheduled transactions are create just like ordinary transactions, except with a future date. Recurring transactions can only be created from the dialogs, with recurrences specified in the second tab.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="recurrence.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			The next occurrence of each scheduled transaction is displayed in the schedule view. You can edit or delete either the single occurrence or all future recurrences. If a single occurrence is edited, it will be created as a separate transaction, and any changes made to all recurrences will not affect this occurrence. If the date is changed to the current or a past date, the scheduled transaction becomes an ordinary transaction.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="schedule-view.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			When a scheduled transaction is due, when the current date has gone past the date of the occurrence (or same date after 6 pm), <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> will ask you to confirm that the transaction really has occurred. You are then given the option to accept the transaction as it is, make some changes (for example the cost of your telephone bill might variate slightly), or postpone it. If the scheduled transaction is not postponed, it will become an ordinary transaction.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="confirm-schedule.png"></div><p>
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="securities"></a>Securities</h2></div></div></div><p>
		Securities represents money invested in stock, bonds and mutual funds. Securities and associated statistics are displayed in the securities view (accessed using the icons on the left).
	</p><p>
		The create a new security in <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> use <span class="guimenu">Securities</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">New Security...</span> or the <span class="guibutton">New Security...</span> button. First select account. Securities are associated with an account of securities type, which cannot be associated with ordinary transactions. Enter name of the security and select type. Specify initial shares if you do not want to back-track all transactions (it is always preferred to use transactions instead, for better statistics). Specify then also date and quotation.
		</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="new-security.png"></div><p>
	</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="security_transactions"></a>Security Transactions</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The following transactions are supported for securities:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Shares bought</span></dt><dd><p>When more shares of a security have been bought. Specify new shares, price per share (quotation given) and total cost, including fees/commission.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="security-buy.png"></div></dd><dt><span class="term">Shares sold</span></dt><dd><p>When some shares of a security have been sold. Specify new shares, price per share and total cost, including fees/commission.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Shares traded</span></dt><dd><p>When shares of one security are sold and shares of another security are bought for the same amount of money, without transfer of sell income to an account in between.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Dividend</span></dt><dd><p>When money is received for each share of a security. Specify income and income category.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Reinvested dividend</span></dt><dd><p>When dividend is received as additional shares.</p></dd></dl></div><p>
		</p><p>
			All security transactions are listed listed as transfers (in the transfers view), except dividends, and shares bought if associated with an income category, which are displayed as incomes. You can list all transactions for a single security using <span class="guimenu">Securities</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Transactions...</span> (or the context menu).
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="securities_view"></a>The Securities View</h3></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="securities-view.png"></div><p>
			Statistics displayed for each security:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Value</span></dt><dd><p>Value at period end date date (quotation * shares).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Quotation</span></dt><dd><p>Price per share at period end date.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Shares</span></dt><dd><p>Shares at period end date.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cost</span></dt><dd><p>Total price paid for all buys minus sells, at end date.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Profit</span></dt><dd><p>Profit during the period (value + dividends - cost).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Yearly Rate</span></dt><dd><p>Percent increase of value per share (for a share bought at the beginning of the period), during the period on a yearly basis. Includes dividends.</p></dd></dl></div><p>
			In the total statistics displayed below the security list, quotation and yearly rate are weighted based on the value of each security.
		</p><p>
			Predictions are simplistic and base on previous development, with respect to dividends and quotations, only. Future quotations are calculated using quotations during the nearest past time. The quotation one month from current date is assumed to have increased at the same rate as during the past month (or the date before with a specified quotation). Dividends are always predicted using full past years (they are assumed to occur on a yearly basis).

		When you have made some changes you need to save your work. Save the file using <span class="guimenu">File</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Save</span> (<span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span>) or the corresponding toolbar button. The first time your work is saved <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> will ask for a location and name for the file. <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> will then automatically open that file each time the program is started.
	</p><p>
		If when exiting <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> there are some changes that have been made after the last save, you will be asked if the file should be saved before closing. If you in the dialog toggle <span class="guilabel">Do not ask again</span> and click <span class="guibutton">Yes</span> the file will automatically be saved each time <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> is closed.
		</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ask-save.png"></div><p>
	</p><p>
		Before the file is saved, a backup copy is made with the name prefixed by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">~</span>”</span>. Also, at most once per minute, the current data is saved (in the default KDE autosave folder, usually ~/autosave), to prevent data loss in case <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> exits unexpectedly (if for example you by accident hit the reset button on the computer).

QIF is a file format that might differ much depending on the software that saved the file. How much details you will need to provide about the file depends on ambiguity of the date format, how localised the file is, and how well accounts are defined.
