	The main window consists of six different views. When Eqonomize! is started, the account view is shown. To change view click on the corresponding icon in the horizontal list above.
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="accounts_and_categories"></a>Accounts &amp; Categories</h2></div></div></div><p>
		The first time you start Eqonomize! the account view is displayed with a predefined set of accounts and categories. These can be considered as an example or a starting point for a setup matching your own conditions. You can either begin by modifying the suggested accounts and categories or start from scratch with <span class="guimenu">File</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">New</span> (<span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>N</strong></span>).
	</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="new-account.png"></div><p>
		Accounts should be created to match your real world bank accounts plus at least one account for your cash. Categories are used to keep incomes and expenses better organised. Each transaction must be connected to an account and a category, or two accounts for transfers between accounts. To create accounts and categories use <span class="guimenu">Accounts</span> menu or the context menu in the list. Accounts and categories can also be added as needed when entering new transactions.
	</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="budget"></a>Budget</h3></div></div></div><p>
			Eqonomize! allows you to specify a budget for each month and category. This way you can continuously compare actual and planned expenses. You can also check what your current budget will mean for your future wealth.
		</p><p>
			A budget is initially asked for when creating a category. Then you can update it from the budget tab at the bottom of the accounts view, for the category selected in the list. If the budget has not been set for a month, the budget for the previous month is used.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="edit-budget.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			You can choose to set budgets for only some categories. In the accounts list, budget and remaining budget (budget - expenses/incomes) is displayed in the second column. If not all categories have a budget, the total remaining budget only summarises the categories with budget and thus does not include actual expenses/incomes from other categories.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="account_view"></a>The Accounts View</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The account view displays a list of all accounts and categories, sorted alphabetically under each main type – accounts, incomes, and expenses. The rows for the main types displays the sum of all accounts/categories below.
		</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="accounts-view.png"></div><p>
			The list has four columns. The first simply displays the name of the account or category. The second does for categories display the budget for the selected period and what is left of the budget. Unless the <span class="guibutton">Show partial budget</span> option is checked, the budget (and remaining budget) is displayed for whole months, thus you can in the default mode see whats left to spend of the current monthly budget. The third column displays the change in value, while the last column displays the total value.
		</p><p>
			In the bottom of the accounts view, there is a box for selection period. The period controls within which dates statistics will be shown in the list. If the button for the from (start) date is unchecked, all transactions up til and including the to (end) date will be included. The third, <span class="guilabel">Change</span>, column displays the value of all transactions that occurred between the two dates – the change in total value from start to end date. The last column (<span class="guilabel">Total</span>) displays the total value of all transaction up til and including the end date, plus the initial balance for accounts. If from date is unset, change and total will be equal for all categories. For accounts the total represents the actual money present at the end date, and change the profit during the period.
		</p><p>
			By default, the period is set to run from the beginning of the current month to (including) current date. Thus, the current state of accounts and transactions so far during the month are shown.
		</p><p>
			Values for future dates are based on budgets and scheduled transactions (whichever is greatest). An account can be designated as budget account (default for current accounts), meaning that budgeted change will be added to the statistics displayed for this account. Otherwise this will only be added to the summarising account item (thus it will not necessarily equal the sum of account statistics).
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions"></a>Transactions</h2></div></div></div><p>
		After accounts and categories have been added, you can start recording transactions each time money have been deposited or withdrawn from one of you accounts. If you have kept book before, either on paper, or in another program, you can either import a file (see <a class="xref" href="using-eqonomize.html#import_export" title="Import &amp; Export of Data">the section called “Import &amp; Export of Data”</a>) or enter each transaction manually by hand. Just remember to enter the correct opening balance for each account.
	</p>n
	<p>
		Transactions can be entered in two ways, either with the new expense/income/transfer dialogs (where you have the option to create a recurring transaction), or from the transaction views. The latter option is usually preferred.
	</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions_expenses"></a>Expenses</h3></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="expenses-view.png"></div><p>
			The first time you record an expense you should follow these steps:
			</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Switch to the expenses view, using the top icons. The input focus is now in the description entry.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type in a description for the expense. Your free to use the description property as you want, but I suggest you keep short and consistent without any inflections, as a subcategory for optimum efficiency and good statistics. For example, if you buy a delicious red Ingraid Marie apple and have an expense category for fruit, the description will be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Apple</span>”</span>, and if you want to record additional information put <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Delicious red Ingraid Marie apple</span>”</span> as comment (others might find it more appropriate to use <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Groceries</span>”</span> as category and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Fruit</span>”</span> as description). Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>Tab</strong></span> and focus will move to the cost entry.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Enter what you paid. Note that the value should not be negative (except for refunds) and you do not need to type in currency. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>Tab</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Optionally enter a quantity (if you bought multiple apples). Note that the previously entered value is the total cost and independent of the quantity. This and the payee field can be hidden from the settings menu if not used. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>Tab</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select the date when the transaction occurred. To change the date, either write a valid date, select one from the pop-up calendar, or increment/decrement the displayed date with up/down keys. If you now press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>, the new expense record will be created, but we do not do that now since the current account and category probably are not correct.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select the correct account (where the money for the expense is taken from) and expense category from the drop-down lists on the right.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Optionally enter a payee (the store where you bought the apple).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Optionally enter a comment (memo) for the expense.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="guibutton">Add</span> or press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> adds a transaction if pressed with input focus in the date or comment entry. Otherwise it moves input focus to the next entry.</p></div><p>
			Repeat the process to record another expense. When you enter the next (and all subsequent expenses) expense you can however usually do it more efficiently. Date, account and category will not be reset each time, so often you need at least not change account. More importantly Eqonomize! remembers the last expense entered for each unique description. When you enter a description, all values, except date, will be filled in with the properties of the last expense with the same description. Even more so, as you type the description a list will pop up with all previous descriptions with matching opening letters. This means that you often will follow this much shorter process:
			</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Type the first letter of a description and select the correct one from the list.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Check if the cost is the same this time and press enter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Press enter to move past the quantity field, if enabled.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Check the date and press enter.</p></li></ol></div><p>
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions_incomes"></a>Incomes</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The same process as for recording expenses is repeated for incomes, except that the quantity field is absent. Click the incomes icon on the left and enter an income instead of a cost (still positive, but instead means amount deposited, added, to the account).
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions_transfer"></a>Transfers</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The record a transfer from one account to another (for example an ATM withdrawal from a bank account to cash) follow the same process as for expenses and incomes. Click the transfer icon on the left. Enter the amount transferred (positive) and select the from account (withdrawn from) and the to account (deposited to).
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="refunds_and_repayments"></a>Refunds &amp; Repayments</h3></div></div></div><p>
			You should record a refund instead of an income when you receive money as a refund for a previous expense, to get the statistics right. This can for example be if you return a product and get your money back, or if you buy a present that you and your friend will give to a mutual friend, and you receive your friends share of the cost later.
		</p><p>
			The record a new refund use <span class="guimenu">Transactions</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">New Refund/Repayment</span> or the context menu with the refunded expense selected in the expense list. You will have to enter the amount of money refunded (initially set to full refund) and the date of the refund. In addition you should specify the product quantity returned by you. In the first case this is clearly 1, but in the second case this is less clear. It can either be 0.5 if you count it as a half product, or 0 if considered a whole gift (none returned). The use is more obvious if the quantity property is activated for all expenses and incomes. The refund is recorded as an expense with negative cost and quantity.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="refund.png"></div><p>
		</p><p>
			Repayments are used as refunds, but for incomes that you have been forced to repay.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="saving"></a>Saving</h2></div></div></div><p>
		When you have made some changes you need to save your work. Save the file using <span class="guimenu">File</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Save</span> (<span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span>) or the corresponding toolbar button. The first time your work is saved Eqonomize! will ask for a location and name for the file. Eqonomize! will then automatically open that file each time the program is started.
	</p><p>
		If when exiting Eqonomize! there are some changes that have been made after the last save, you will be asked if the file should be saved before closing. If you in the dialog toggle <span class="guilabel">Do not ask again</span> and click <span class="guibutton">Yes</span> the file will automatically be saved each time Eqonomize! is closed.
		</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ask-save.png"></div><p>
	</p><p>
		Before the file is saved, a backup copy is made with the name prefixed by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">~</span>”</span>. Also, at most once per minute, the current data is saved (in the default KDE autosave folder, usually ~/autosave), to prevent data loss in case Eqonomize! exits unexpectedly (if for example you by accident hit the reset button on the computer).
	</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="import_export"></a>Import &amp; Export of Data</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="qif_import"></a>QIF Import</h3></div></div></div><p>
			Select <span class="guimenu">File</span> → <span class="guisubmenu">Import</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Import QIF File...</span> and follow the instructions. QIF is a file format that might differ much depending on the software that saved the file. How much details you will need to provide about the file depends on ambiguity of the date format, how localised the file is, and how well accounts are defined. Securities, investment transactions, memorised transactions, budgets, and classes are not imported.
			</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="qif-date-format.png"></div><p>
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="csv_import"></a>CSV Import</h3></div></div></div><p>
			This function imports data files with clear text values in columns separated by a character (comma, space, tab, etc.), with a new transaction on each row. Select <span class="guimenu">File</span> → <span class="guisubmenu">Import</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Import CSV File...</span> and enter details about the structure of the file you want to import. Transaction parameters can either be imported from a column in the file or a set to a specified value.
