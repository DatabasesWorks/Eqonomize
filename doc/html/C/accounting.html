			The basics principle behind accounting in <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> is the idea of money flowing through transactions between accounts as reservoirs. A transaction represents a gain (you receive money), loss (you buy something), or transformation (you withdray from or deposit in a bank account) of money.
		</p><p>
			A transaction always means that money is moved from one account to another. An expense (something is bought) can for example mean that you pay with cash from your cash account. The money is then put in an expense account. This account represents the products and services you pay for. It represents the money that you do not have as a result of expenses, and is therefor useful for record keeping.
		</p><p>
			Incomes is usually put in a bank account and withdrawn from an income account. This means that income accounts will have a negative value, but to avoid confusion, the value of income accounts are shown as positive values.
		</p><p>
			Different income and expense accounts are used for categorisation, and are therefor more naturally referred to as categories. Other accounts, which represents the money you actually have and often are real world bank accounts, are simply referred to as accounts.

			<span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> has three different basic transactions types – expenses, incomes, and transfers. Securities uses some special transactions which are described in <a class="xref" href="accounting.html#accounting-securities" title="Securities">the section called “Securities”</a>.
		</p><p>
			Expenses represents a loss of money, a transaction where you give away money, mostly in return for something else. This can be a payment for products and services, or a gift (or you lend someone money).
		</p><p>
			Incomes represents a gain of money; when you are given money. This is when your at the other end of an expense, when you receive payment for products and services you provide (often as salary for your regular job), or when someone gives you money as a gift or loan.
		</p><p>
			The third transaction type, the transfer, represents neither a loss nor gain, but a transfer of money from one account to another. This can for example be when you withdraw money from your bank account as cash, or you transfer money to a savings account.
		</p><p>
			Each transaction has a number of mandatory or optional properties. All the basic transactions have four mandatory properties – value, date, and from and to accounts/categories. Value represents the amount of money that is affected by the transaction, date when the transaction occurred, from account where the money was taken from and to account where money was put. These are the generic property names, which shows that all transaction types basically are the same.
		</p><p>
			For expenses the value is a cost, a positive value representing a loss of money and the to account/category is called category and the from account/category is the account that the expense is payed from. The category is always an expense category and the from account/category an account.
		</p><p>
			For incomes the value is an income, a positive value representing a gain of money and the from account/category is called category and the the to account/category is the account that the income is deposited in. The category is always an income category and the to/from account an account.
		</p><p>
			For transfers the value is called amount, and the to and from accounts/categories are both accounts.

			All transactions do in addition have two optional properties. The description property provides information about the nature of the transaction. For expenses and incomes this can be considered a flexible subcategory. The comment property is used for any additional information, not used for categorisation, about the transaction. If you for example buy a pair of shoes, you might create an expense in a clothing category, with the description <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Shoes</span>”</span> and comments <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Shiny red Pradas</span>”</span>.
		</p><p>
			Expenses and incomes do also have two properties which are not by default activated in the program. The quantity property denotes how many entities was involved in the transaction. This can be a whole number, as in two CD's, or a fraction, as in 0.56 kg apples (units are not included). This property is by default set to 1 and does not affect the value (the value per entity equals the value divided by the quantity). Expenses also have a payee property for the person or entity, for example the store where goods where bought, which receives the money, and incomes have payer property for the one who gives you the money, for example your employer.

			A scheduled transaction is a transaction that is planned to occur, thus it has not occurred yet. It is basically just a transaction, of any type, that has a date set in the future. When a scheduled transaction has occurred, it becomes a regular transaction. Scheduled transactions makes it possible to keep track of and be reminded of future transactions. <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> will request for a confirmation when the transaction is expected to have occurred.
		</p><p>
			A scheduled transaction can be recurring, thus it will regularly occur on a certain date or with a certain interval. This is useful mostly for bills and salaries, which then need not be entered manually each time and you can check <span class="application">Eqonomize!</span> for upcoming payments. When a scheduled recurring transaction has occurred, a regular transaction is created, the occurrence date is removed from the recurrence, and the scheduled transaction date is moved forward to the next occurrence. A scheduled transaction with no occurrences left is removed.
