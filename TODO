BUGS:
- sometimes accounts aren't selectable after renaming etc. (?)
- second combo in time development diagram (on "Source:" line) is not updated when the first combo is changed. Thus it is possible that the graphic doesn't correspond to the items selected in this combo (?)
- charts need meaningful window titles.
- saving in .eqz is very slow (?)
- changing the year in the graph view is VERY long (?)
- crash when trying to delete an operation from an account view.
- schedules don't always function (vague but reproducible) (?)

recent transactions, etc.)
