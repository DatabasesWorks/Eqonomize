BUGS:
- sometimes accounts aren't selectable after renaming etc. (?)
- second combo in time development diagram (on "Source:" line) is not updated when the first combo is changed. Thus it is possible that the graphic doesn't correspond to the items selected in this combo (?)
- charts need meaningful window titles.
- saving in .eqz is very slow (?)
- changing the year in the graph view is VERY long (?)
- in graphs with too many items, limit to max biggest 10.
- crash when trying to delete an operation from an account view.
- schedules don't always function (vague but reproducible) (?)
- startup is slow when installed (xmlgui reads its rc) but not in build dir (xmlgui not finding rc file) (?)

FEATURES:

- Loans: at the moment loans can only be handled by using regular
account with negative value and transfers for paying off the loan.
- Subcategories: requires a lot of work since at affects much of the
code, but has been requested by many. The reason it wasn't implemented
is that I find that if descriptions are used wisely, subcategories are
not needed.
- A beautiful summary view (with summary of assets, pending payments,
recent transactions, etc.)
- Reconciliation: "We all make mistakes at times and it would be nice to
be able to reconcile one's entries with a Bank Statement"
- Alternative to match sub-strings not in the beginning of word in
filters.
- Security: encrypt files?
- Import and export more file types: OFX, Gnucash, kmymoney2, etc.
- Test QIF import/export (I have not been able to do any real world
testing)
- Load quotations from external sources
- Chart for quotations
- More visualisations (charts)
- New icons: ex. replace the generic left and right arrows for incomes
and expenses
- Undo
- Enhance manual
- Gnome UI: it would fit my desktop environment better, but not really
worth the effort.
- Recurring split transactions
- Multiple currencies
- Plugins? Scripts?

- support for importing eqz files (so that we can do merging of files)
- support for saving views in eqz format (e.g. splitting data in separate files)
- make ledgers similar to expense/income views
